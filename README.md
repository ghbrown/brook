## brook \*

Compute finite difference approximations to derivatives of multidimensional, multivariate functions.

Unlike [`findiff`](https://github.com/maroba/findiff) and [`fastfd`](https://github.com/stefanmeili/FastFD), the focus of `brook` is on computing higher order derivative objects (gradients, Jacobians, Hessians, etc.) for problems like optimization and the solution of nonlinear equations.
Of course, it may also be used to numerically verify handcoded implementations of said objects.

\* after [Brook Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_Taylor), the namesake for Taylor series and the originator of finite differences


## Planned workflow for repo
See `media/plan.jpg` for the proposed workflow to generate the desired derivatives
